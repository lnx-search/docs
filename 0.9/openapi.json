This is because the index is schema-full and requires fields exist\nif define (This may change in future releases.)\n- Creating indexes are **VERY HEAVY** operations, not only are you acquiring a global lock across\nall indexes stopping anything else completing operations but you are also spawning and creating\nseveral threads and thread pools (more on this later.) They should not be made randomly during \nusage and should not be made via some user input *THIS WILL CAUSE SERIOUS ISSUES OTHERWISE*.\n- Deleting indexes clear all data stored, this means any previously uploaded documents will be\nremoved.\n- The `max_concurrency` determines the amount of readers proportionally, and \nthe `reader_threads` determines the amount of threads each reader gets, \ntherefore you spawn at least `max_concurrency` x `reader_threads` + `writer_threads` + `1` (for writer thread)\n\n### Support Field Data Types\n- `string` This is similar to `text` but wont be indexed. (Supports `stored` bool)\n- `text` This is similar to `string` but will be indexed. (Supports `stored` bool)\n- `f64` A 64 bit floating point integer field.

(Supports [IntOptions](/getting_started/creating_a_index.html#int-options))\n- `date` A UTC datetime field, stored as a u64 integer. (Supports [IntOptions](/getting_started/creating_a_index.html#int-options))\n\n\n### Int Options\nIf a field is *in italic* it's optional and not required.\n\n- `indexed`: bool - Whether or not to index this field. \nSetting an integer as indexed will generate a posting list for each value taken by the integer.\n\n- *`fast`: 'single' or 'multi'* - Set the field as a fast field with a\ngiven cardinality which makes it either a single-value or multi-value field. \nFast fields are designed for random access.\nAccess time are similar to a random lookup in an array.\nIf more than one value is associated to a fast field, only the last one is kept.\n\n- `stored`: bool - Set the field as stored.\nOnly the fields that are set as *stored* are persisted into the store.\n"},{"name":"üì∑ Snapshots","description":"Snapshots were first introduced in `v0.8.0` and provide a basic layer of wrapping up the index directory into a\nsingle compressed file.\n\n## Caveats\nThis allows you to restore your index from a previous snapshot however, there are some caveats:\n\n- Snapshots between versions may not be compatible if the underlying storage system has changed, although rare there\n  is an experimental plan later on to change the storage system.\n- The bigger the index the slower the snapshot process, the snapshotting system is single threaded both extracting\n  and wrapping in the first place. This allows for the rest of the system to feel minimal impact when the process is\n  running but at the cost of the time it takes to produce the archive.\n  On larger datasets this is probably a bad idea to have set up and instead consider just maintaining a separate back up\n  of the index metadata e.g. schema, stopwords (if applicable), etc... and then the data originally indexed itself.\n  On modern hardware you can index your 50GB of data in the fraction of the time it takes to decompress and export\n  the equivalent snapshot. \n  An important point: **lnx should not be your primary data store, nor does it expect to be used like one.**\n\n## Creating a snapshot\nTo create a snapshot you can run lnx with the `--snapshot` flag to produce a once off save.\ne.g.\n```shell\nlnx --snapshot\n```\n\nIf you want to take a snapshot ever `n` hours you can do so with the `--snapshot-interval <hours>` flag.\n\nFor example to take a snapshot every 24 hours.\n```shell\nlnx --snapshot-interval 24\n```\n\n*NOTE: The limits for this interval are between 1 and 255 hours*\n\nThis will produce a file in the format of:\n```\nsnapshot-<timestamp>-lnx-v<lnx-version>\n```\n\n## Changing output directory\nBy default, lnx will produce snapshots in the `snapshots` directory relative to it's CWD.\n\nYou can change this by passing the `--snapshot-directory <path>` flag.\n\ne.g.\n```shell\nlnx --snapshot-directory some_folder --snapshot\n```\n\n\n## Loading snapshots\nTo load snapshots you can pass the `--load-snapshot <file>` flag when running lnx.\nThis sub command will load the data from the snapshot and prep it to be used by lnx.\n\ne.g.\n```shell\nlnx --load-snapshot ./snapshot-124213411-lnx-v0.8.0\n```"},{"name":"üíæ Managing transactions","description":"Transactions are one of the most important things in lnx, they control what data is seen by\nthe reader and what data is actually fully processed and saved.\n\nThe core concept of the transactions work on the same basis of tradition database transactions\nwith a one major difference:\n\n- There *should* only ever be **ONE** system interacting with a writer for a specific index at a time.\nThe system processes writes in single a queue, so if one system adds a document and another commits\nthen the document will be finalized and flushed to disk.</br> \n**It is highly recommended to wrap the writing endpoints in a lock**\n\n- Transactions are implicit vs explicit meaning you dont declare a transaction\nyou simple call commit and rollback respectively which apply their relevant affects\non writes made **since the last commit** once something is committed it cannot be rolled back.\n"},{"name":"üìÉ Managing documents","description":"Documents can only be added or removed, not updated.\nThis is preferred to be done explicitly hence no update endpoint.\n\nEach document is given a unique 64 bit integer which is returned as a string so\nthat it can be accessed later."},{"name":"‚öôÔ∏è Synonyms & Stopwords","description":"Synonyms and stopwords can be added to improve relevancy when searching.\n\nBy default, LNX comes with a set of popular stop words for the following languages:\n- English(en) \n- German (de)\n- Spanish (es)\n- French (fr)\n- Hebrew (he)\n- Italian (it)\n- Russian (ru)\n- Chinese (zh)\n\n"},{"name":"üîç Run searches","description":"Once you've added documents to you're ready to start searching!\n\nlnx provides you with 4 major ways to query the index:\n- `normal` The tantivy query parse system, this is not typo tolerant but is very powerful for custom user queries, think log searches.\n- `fuzzy`* A fuzzy query, this ignores the custom query system that the standard query parser would otherwise handle, but intern is typo tolerant.\n    *  if you have `use_fast_fuzzy` set to `true` for your given index this will\nuse the fast fuzzy system. \n- `more-like-this` Unlike the previous two options this takes a document reference address and produces documents similar to the given one.

You can calculate the permission integer you need by taking\nthe bitwise `OR` / `|` of two permissions acting as a permission1 + permission2 flag.\nfor example if we want our token to be able to modify documents and search the index\nwe can do:\n\n```\npermissions = 1 << 2 | 1 << 1\n```\n\n"},{"name":"‚ö° Optimising your index","description":"# Understanding Your Workload\nNot every set of data is going to have the same optimum configuration, there\nare a few points you probably want to be aware of when choosing your settings.\n\n### Large Datasets (millions+ of documents)\nSearching large datasets can benefit from having a larger number of reader\nthreads and a lower max concurrency set, having a low number of reader threads\nand a high concurrency has the negative affect of trying to run many searches\nat once very slowly vs a few searches very quickly. \n\nThere is also a hard capped limit on how much your system can actually handle.\nIf you set the max concurrency beyond what your system can handle you will\nseg fault at high loads which is a un-recoverable error. \n\n### Small Datasets (thousands+ of documents)\nSmaller datasets often cannot make good use of a larger number of reader threads,\nthis is because the data is not split into enough segments to make full use of\nthe parallel computation.\n\nOften with smaller datasets you're better having a higher concurrency and a lower\nnumber of reader threads.\n\nFor example, the movies.json dataset as part of the demo app is roughly most\noptimised at 1 or 2 reader threads and `n * 3` max concurrency where `n` is the\nnumber of cpu cores on the machine. \nThis can still change though depending on the clock speed of your CPU so still \nbenchmark and test before sticking with a configuration.\n"}]}
